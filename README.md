Python code and jupyter notebooks used as part of the course Lessons in Advanced Astroinformatics.

Folders `_data` and `outputs` are not included in this repository due to its large size. Some sample results are available in `selected_results`.

## Contents

### Notebooks
1. `notebook_1a.ipynb`: Getting Started
2. `notebook_1b.ipynb`: Plotting TESS light curves
3. `notebook_2.ipynb`: Light curve features (I): Fourier transformation, Lomb-Scargle Periodogram, and the feature extraction from the `feets` package
4. `notebook_3.ipynb`: Light curve features (II)
5. `notebook_4.ipynb`: Recap
6. `notebook_5.ipynb`: Machine Learning: Intro to Scikit-Learn


### Scripts
1. `script_extract_features.py`: Extract features from all lc data, using feet + custom versions of AndersonDarling stat and Stetson K-index. For each version of the lc it produces a table with the object name, variability type and features values.
